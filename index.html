    <h2>WELCOME TO CLIMATE CHANGE </h2>

    <p>Climate change can be a natural process where temperature, rainfall, wind and other elements vary over decades or
      more. In millions of years, our world has been warmer and colder than it is now.</p>

    <body>
      <p>Text:Increasing greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.These come from burning fossil fuels such as
        gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon
        dioxide. Landfills for garbage are another source. Energy, industry, agriculture and waste disposal are among
        the major emitters. </p>
